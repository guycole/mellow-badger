Mellow Badger enables control of a [RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com) USB dongle using a REST framework.

## 
Introduction
Mellow Badger provides a REST application which can control a [RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com) USB dongle.  The overall goal is to control a family of single board computers (such as the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) to perform automated signal collection.  A fleet of inexpensive computers and receivers can have impressive capabilities, especially for narrowband collection tasks.

Mellow Badger emphasizes autonomous operation over manual, so there is no user interface.  Audio is produced, but the emphasis is on recording or writing to a remote network host.
